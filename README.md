# GALAX üöÄ
### Guided Astronaut Learning And eXploration

*Your journey to the stars begins here.*

**GALAX** is an immersive, educational platform where students train to become astronauts through interactive missions guided by real NASA astronauts. Powered by AI mentors and realistic simulations, GALAX transforms space education into an engaging, hands-on experience.
